Overview

Problem:
How do farmers maximize their crop yield over a given season?  The idea is to have a calendar of 12 months of 30 days,
where each day can have 0-x inches of rain.  0 would be considered a "sunny" day, and anything else would be that amount
of rain.  At the beginning of a season, a farmer is assigned a list of different crops (tomatoes, potatoes, apricots, etc)
which require different amounts of sun/rain over a given growing period.  Using Genetic Algorithms, we will have a chromosone
population which will represent the different days you could plant a given farm, and how successful that farm is. (Based on
the amount of crops that make it to "yield" point.)

Constraints:
  Rather than restrict based on exact plant makeup, we will "randomly" assign plants to a given farm, and then do cross over based on
  days.
